If you haven't yet, create API services for getting albums. Design of API is up to you.

Write angular services that encapsulate API calls and use those in your components.

Make your API url configured via an angular value (you can make your services providers if you'd rather).

Bonus: Handle multiple albums **2pts**

# Rubric
Server API: 3pts
Angular Services: 3pts
Consume services in components: 4pts

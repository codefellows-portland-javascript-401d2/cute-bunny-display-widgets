## Angular photo library app with cute bunnies

This repo includes both the app and the server.

##### To install, clone this repo then...

    cd app
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ../server
    npm install
    npm run dev

    The server will be listening on port 3000 by default.

    The app can also be launched without the server using webpack-dev-server.
    Inside the app folder, type 'npm run start' (will be listening on port 8080).


##### Tests are available:

    npm test

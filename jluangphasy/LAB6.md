===

Your app needs to be able to handle multiple albums (or add some other level of data complexity). 

Your app needs to be navigable via linking that utilizes the UI router to change the app state.

Use nested views and/or named views as appropriate for your app.

At a minimum, you should have:

* welcome "page"
* "page" with list of available albums
* "page" with images of selected album

User should be able to CRUD albums and images in albums

# Rubric
* Use of ui-router: **7pts**
* Design of states based on app: **7pts**
* Integration of ui-router with app (passing states or other details): **6pts**

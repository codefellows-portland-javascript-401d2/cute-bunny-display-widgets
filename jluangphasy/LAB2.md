===

After the fantastic community reaction to your single Bunny Display Widget, you've decided to add the ability
to display an album (list) of cute bunny photos.

Your enhancements:
1. Make the display state (list, tile, thumb) dynamic and only show one display state at a time.
2. Create an album component that lists from an array of images (can still be hard-coded in the app).
The album should list appropriately based on the display state.
3. Style your project using scss running via webpack loader. Styles should be well-organized (general things
are general, component-specific things are component specific).
